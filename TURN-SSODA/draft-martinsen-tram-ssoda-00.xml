      <t>
        This draft describes a simple method for allocating one IPv4
        and one IPv6 relay address from a single ALLOCATE request to
        the TURN server. This saves local ports on the client, reduces
        the number of candidates gathered by the client, and
        reduces the number of messages sent between the client and the
        TURN server.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The main motivation for this draft is to reduce the number of
        local ports on the client, reduce the number of candidates
        gathered during the discovery process, and reduce the number of
        messages that need to be exchanged to allocate the relay addresses
        needed for ICE. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Reducing the number of local ports is important as it saves
        resources at three places in the network. First, the number of 
        open ports on the client is reduced, leading to fewer host
        candidates. Secondly, with fewer local host ports
        there will be fewer NAT bindings for the NAT to keep track
        of, and fewer server reflexive candidates.
        Lastly, with a single 5-tuple in use, it reduces the number of 
        open ports the TURN server needs to open on the interface towards 
        the client (Private side). As ports are a scarce resource
        (16-bit number) preserving them on the NAT and a the TURN server
        can make large scale deployments easier.

    <section title="Creating an Allocation">
      <t>
        The behavior specified here affects the processing defined in Section
        6 of <xref target="RFC5766" /> and Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6156" />. 
      </t>
      <section title="Sending an Allocate Request" anchor="create_allocation">
        <t>
          A client that wishes to obtain one IPv6 and one IPv4 by
          sending one Allocate request MUST include two
          REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes, one for each address
          family, in the Allocate request that it sends to the TURN
          server. The order of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY is arbitrary,
	  because the server either understands SSODA (then the order 
	  does not matter) or the server does not understand SSODA 
	  (then the server bahavior is undefined - it may return a 400 error,
	  or it may take the first attribute, or it may take the last attribute).
          Multiple candidates of the same family are not supported; the 
          client MUST NOT include more than one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
          attribute for a given address family. The mechanism to formulate
          an Allocate request is described in Section 6.1 of
          <xref target="RFC5766" />.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          Clients MUST NOT include a REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
          attribute in an Allocate request that contains a
          RESERVATION-TOKEN or an EVEN-PORT attributes. The SSODA 
	  mechanism is not available when using the odd/even port
	  allocation scheme.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Receiving an Allocate Request">
        <t>
          Once a server has verified that the request is authenticated
          and has not been tampered with, the TURN server processes
          the Allocate request following the rules in
          <xref target="RFC5766" /> and <xref target="RFC6156"/>..
          Only one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute with the
          same family value is allowed in the request. If two
          attributes with the same family value exist the server MUST
          return 400 Bad Request error.
        </t>
        <t>  
          If no REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes are present, the
          server MUST treat this as if the request contained a single
          REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY specifying the IPv4 address family.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the server can successfully process the request, it
          allocates a relay address for each of the
          REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes present in the Allocate
          request. The allocated relay addresses are returned in separate
          XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attributes in the Allocate response
          message. The ordering of the XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attributes 
	  is arbitrary.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the server cannot satisfy the request at all, because none
          of the specified address families are supported, the server
          MUST return a 440 error code, as indicated in
          <xref target="RFC6156"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the server cannot satisfy the request at all, because the
          server could not allocate any of the specified adresses, the
          server MUST return a 508 (Insufficient Capacity) error code as
          indicated in <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If some of the requested address could be allocated, but some
          could not, either because the requested address family is not 
          supported, or the server currently lacks capacity, the server
          MUST indicate this partial success by returning an Allocate
          Success Response that contains XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attributes 
          for the addresses that were successfully allocated, as well as
          XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS with ANY addresses (that is,
	  IPv4 address 0.0.0.0:0 or IPv6 address [::0]:0) 
	  corresponding to the address families that could not be
	  allocated. This will notify the client that the desired
	  REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY was understood, but could not be
	  allocated. A success response with ANY addresses MUST NOT
	  be returned if all allocation requests cannot be satisfied;
	  instead, an error response should be returned, as indicated
	  above.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This somewhat unusual pattern of partial success is used to
	  avoid the need for an additional roundtrip when the client
	  just wants whatever address families the TURN server supports.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that while allocating multiple address families at the
          same time is supported, doing this sequentially is not. The
          server MUST reject any attempt to "add" an address family
          to an existing allocation with a 437 (Allocation Mismatch)
          error code.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving an Allocate Success Response">
	<t>
	  This section describes how the client must react on
	  receiving a response to the dual allocation request.
	  If the client is not using dual allocation, then the behavior 
	  is the same as the rules in <xref target="RFC5766" /> 
	  and in <xref target="RFC6156" />.
	</t>
        <t>
          If the client receives an Allocate Success Response containing
          a non-ANY (ANY as defined above) XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS 
	  attribute for each of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY 
	  attributes in the Allocate request
          sent by the client, the client knows that the TURN server
          supports multiple address family allocation over a single
          socket. All relay addresses can now be used by the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the Allocate response contains both usable 
          XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attributes as well as ANY
          XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attributes, then the client 
	  knows that the TURN server "understands" dual allocation
	  SSODA request, but the server either does not support one 
	  of the requested address families
	  or cannot currently allocate an address of that family.
	  The allocated non-ANY address can be used, but the client
	  SHOULD NOT try to allocate any of the unsupported families on
	  a different 5-tuple.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the Allocate Response contains only one XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS
          attribute, then the client knows that the TURN server does not
          support SSODA. The client can retry the missing address
          family allocations on new 5-tuples, if desired.
          Subsequent Allocate requests towards the same TURN server
          SHOULD NOT include multiple REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving an Allocate Error Response">
        <t>
          When doing dual allocation, if the client receives an 
          Allocate error response with the
          440 (Unsupported Address Family) error code, then the client
          knows that the TURN server does not support any of the desired
          address families, or might be a non-SSODA server that 
          misinterpreted the included REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
          attributes in the Allocate request. The client SHOULD retry
          its IPv4 request on the same 5-tuple, with no
          REQUSTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute, and MAY retry other
          address families on different local ports, by sending an
          Allocate request with only one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
          attribute.
        </t>
      </section>

    <section title="Refreshing an Allocation">
      <t>
        The behavior specified here affects the processing defined in
        Section 7 of <xref target="RFC5766"/> and Section 5 of
        <xref target="RFC6156" />. This section MUST only be used if
        the client has verified that the TURN server supports SSODA
        during the allocation creation described in <xref target =
        "create_allocation" />. Otherwise, revert back to RFC 5766 or
	RFC 6156 behaviour.
      </t>
      <section title="Sending a Refresh Request">
        <t>
          To perform an allocation refresh, the client generates a
          Refresh Request as described in Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
          When refreshing a dual allocation, the client SHOULD include one or
          more REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes describing the the family
          types that should be refreshed; the client MUST only include
          family types that it previously allocated and has not yet deleted.
          When refreshing a (single) allocation on a server that does not
          not support SSODA, REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY should be omitted, for
          backwards compatibility.
        </t>
        <t>
          This process can also be used to delete an allocation of a
          specific address type, by setting the lifetime of that refresh request
          to 0. It is possible to delete one or
          more allocations depending on how many REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
          attributes are included. Deleting a single allocation destroys
          any permissions or channels associated with that particular allocation;
          it MUST NOT affect any permissions or channels associated with
          allocations for other address families.
        </t>
        
      </section>
      <section title="Receiving a Refresh Request">
        <t>
          The server refreshes the allocated address families that
          match the supplied REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY values. If any of the
          values in the request do not match a currently allocated address,
          the server MUST respond with a 443 (Peer Address Family Mismatch) error.
          
          If no REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY is present, the request should be
          treated as applying to all current allocations, for backward
          compatibility.
        </t>
        <t>
          The server MUST then refresh or delete the specified allocations,
          and return a Refresh Success Response.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="CreatePermission">
        <t>
          The behavior specified here affects the processing defined
          in Section 9 of <xref target="RFC5766"/> and Section 6 of
          <xref target="RFC6156" />
        </t>
        <section title="Sending a CreatePermission Request">
          <t>
            The client MUST only include XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attributes
            with addresses that match an address family of one of the 
            currently allocated addresses.
          </t>

            address family different than that any of the relayed
            transport addresses allocated, the server MUST
            generate an error response with the 443 (Peer Address
            Family Mismatch) response code, which is defined in
            Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC6156" />.

      <t>
	The session channels setup process follows the same rules as in 
	<xref target="RFC5766"/> and in <xref target="RFC6156" />;
	the client is allowed to set up multiple channels within the same
	5-tuple session. However, when using SSODA and dual allocation,
	the peer addresses of those channels may be of different families.
