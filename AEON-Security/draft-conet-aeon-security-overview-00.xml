    <abstract>
      <t>Application Enabled Collaborative Networking (AECON) discusses the
      need for mechanisms through which applications exchange information
      about their flows with the network to achieve better application
      operation under existing network conditions. The intent is to have
      applications protect the content of their flows, yet have the ability to
      opt-in information exchanges that enable a more precise allocation of
      network resources and thus achieve better user experience. This document
      discusses security implications of such a solution.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
      many application providers and network operators. The problems faced by
      existing solutions that try to provide such visibility to enable
      appropriate treatment of application flows are described in detail in
      <xref target="I-D.conet-aeon-problem-statement"/>.</t>

      <t>As the IETF establishes default behaviors that thwart pervasive
      surveillance (e.g. <xref target="RFC7258"/>), it will be important to
      provide secure mechanism for applications that want to have the network
      provide differential flow treatment for their data.</t>

      <t>It is essential that this model considers security and privacy
      implications to provide protection again false claims, leakage of
      private information, and unwarranted differentiated treatment of flows.
      For example, the network may need to validate application provided flow
      information before using it to provide differential treatment of the
      application's flows. Similarly, an application may need assurance of
      confidentiality protection before providing potentially sensitive
      information.</t>

      <t>TODO</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="AECON" title="AECON approach">
      <t>The goal of AECON is to offer mechanisms to achieve better
      application operation under existing network conditions. AECON's
      approach toward finding solutions to the use cases described in <xref
      target="I-D.conet-aeon-use-cases"/> includes the following steps:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Identify the protocol(s) best fit to solve the problem depending
          on the use case, application that is going to use it, connectivity
          and network type, trust level present in the running environment,
          etc.</t>

          <t>Provide the specification on how the protocol is used to solve
          the problem and describe the required extensions.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Protocol selection">
        <t>Applications continue to grow in number, type and diversity. They
        are running on a multitude of host types and Operating Systems,
        following different delivery models (native, web, cloud). Many use
        peer-to-peer or client-server models and open standard protocols for
        establishing connectivity. Applications run in various environments
        like enterprise, home network, home automation, factory floors,
        hospital setting, utilities etc. Devices hosting the applications may
        connect to the network in various ways, using different technologies,
        having multiple interfaces to the same or different network devices,
        connecting over cable, DSL, FTTH, wireless etc. In order to operate in
        these environments, some applications already run lightweight
        client-server network protocols (e.g. STUN to discover public
        addresses when behind NAT devices, PCP to create explicit port
        forwarding rules etc).</t>

        <t>The AECON solution requires a protocol to be used for signaling the
        application flow characteristics to the network and getting feedback
        from the network. A few existing protocols with new extensions can be
        considered:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Client-server network protocol: PCP with flow meta data
            extensions: Handles both TCP and UDP flows.</t>

            <t>On-path application protocol: STUN with flow meta data
            extensions between hosts. Handles UDP flows.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Flow Metadata Handling">
        <t>In AECON, applications signal their flow characteristics to the
        network. The network responds back to applications with information
        regarding its ability to transport those flows. Depending on its
        nature and needs, the application may provide different flow
        characteristics. As the application requirements change, the flow
        characteristics communicated to the network may be revised. When
        network state changes or when different events occur, a network
        element may provide updated information about its ability to transport
        flows. For example an application may send at startup certain
        bandwidth, delay and jitter requirements for each of its flows. The
        network performs bandwidth accounting against the matching service
        class and sends an acknowledgment to the application.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec_overview" title="Security overview">
      <t>As described previously, AECON addresses a wide range of use cases
      with varying security implications and requirements. It is essential
      that the AECON solution considers all security implications, and that
      the protocols and mechanisms chosen for the solution meet this
      requirements. This section lists a set of basic security requirements
      that any such mechanism/protocol must support.</t>

      <section title="Mutual authentication">
        <t>A basic security requirement is that there must be a mechanism for
        mutual authentication between the application signaling flow
        information and the network entity that uses this flow information to
        provide differential treatment for flows as well as feedback to
        applications about such treatment. Without this, the solution is open
        for attacks with fake applications falsely claiming to be legitimate
        applications that require special treatment i.e. The network
        infrastructure is at risk of being misused. Should the network entity
        be spoofed, applications could be misled that the network has
        accommodated the requested flow characteristics.</t>

        <section title="Integrity protection">
          <t>Integrity protection is necessary to ensure that a
          man-in-the-middle device does not alter the signaling information,
          thus ensuring that the network receives the flow characteristics as
          sent by the client and the client receives flow characteristics
          accommodated by the network. Compromise in integrity could result in
          applications flows not receiving the intended treatment.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Replay Protection">
          <t>The mechanism should have replay protection i.e a network attack
          in which flow characteristics requested by the client and
          accommodated by the network is maliciously or fraudulently repeated
          or delayed. Security guarantees are not possible if the mechanism
          cannot detect and protect itself from replay attacks possibly as
          part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Security with browser-based applications">
        <t>The basic assumption is that browser serves as the user's TRUSTED
        COMPUTING BASE (TCB). Any security property which the user wishes to
        have enforced must be ultimately guaranteed by the browser (or
        transitively by some property the browser verifies). Conversely, if
        the browser is compromised, then no security guarantees are possible.
        Browser must validate the flow characteristics signaled via a
        JavaScript (JS) API and discard any request seeking far more resources
        than actually required or requests far less resources but consumes far
        more resources than the requested flow characteristics.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Privacy">
        <t>An eavesdropping entity should not be able to glean any information
        that could leak privacy-related information like application name from
        the protocol signaling flow characteristics to the network. The best
        protection against privacy related information leakage is to not
        include any such information in the flow characteristics communicated
        between the applications and the network. If a specific use case
        requires communication of privacy related information, that
        information needs confidentiality protection.</t>
