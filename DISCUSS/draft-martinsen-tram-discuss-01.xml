        This draft describes a mechanism for information exchange
        between an application and the network.  The information
        provided from the application to the network MAY be used by a
        network element in the path to modify its behavior to improve
        application quality of experience (QoE).  Likewise, the
        information provided by the network to the application MAY be
        used by the application to modify its behavior to optimize for
        QoE.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In the context of Content, Mobile, Fixed Service, Service
        Providers, Enterprise and Private networks have a need to
        prioritize packet flows end-to-end. These flows are often
        dynamic, time-bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, possibly
        asymmetric, and might have different priorities depending on
        network conditions, direction, time of the day, dynamic user
        preferences and other factors. These factors may be time
        variant, and thus need to be signalled. Moreover, in many
        cases of peer-to-peer communication, flow information is known
        only to the endpoint. These considerations, coupled with the
        trend to use encryption for browser-to-browser communication
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch"/>, imply that
        access lists, deep packet inspection and other static
        prioritization methods cannot be employed successfully to
        prioritize packet flows. 
      </t>
      <t>
        The lack of congestion control in UDP may lead to problems as
        described in <xref target="I-D.eggert-tsvwg-rfc5405bis"/>. The
        mechanism described in this document can be used to introduce
        fairness and congestion control for UDP streams.
      </t>
      <t>
        There is a need for a solution that is easy for the
        application developer to use. That means consistent behavior
        on all supported platforms and preferably without need of
        administrative privileges to set and read values. The solution
        also needs to be able to cross administrative domains without
        the risk of being rewritten. 
        <cref anchor="Q1" source="palmarti">
          This draft will only offer
          tamper detection of some of the values. Further discussion
          regarding the incentive to lie is needed.

      <!--
      <t>
        Todo: Say why we want to have a simpler solution than <xref
        target="RFC6679"/>.
      </t>
      -->
      <t>
        This draft describes how these problems can be solved by
        defining a few strictly defined STUN <xref target="RFC5389"/>
        attributes which can be added to any STUN message the client
        wants to send. STUN messages are typically sent during the ICE
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> connectivity check phase when the
        media session is established, or when keep-alive STUN messages
        are sent after the session is established. The application is
        not limited to those two scenarios, if some communication
        between application and network is needed it can choose to do
        so at any time.
      </t>
      <t>
        Devices on the media path can use the information in the STUN
        attributes to prioritize the flow, perform traffic
        engineering, provide network analytics or as a gateway to
        existing methods for prioritizing flows (DSCP
        <xref target="RFC2474"/>). Applications can use information in
        network status attribute to influence rate stating points or
        rate adaption mechanisms.
      </t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="General Usage">
      <t>
        This draft defines several attributes that can be added to a
        STUN message; STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY
        and NETWORK-STATUS. See <xref target="new_attributes" /> for
        the formal description. It is RECOMMENDED to add them to a
        STUN request response pair, especially if the NETWORK-STATUS
        attribute is in use. This allows the information gathered to
        be sent back to the requesting agent in the the STUN response.
      </t>
      <t>
        The STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY attributes
        MUST be added before any INTEGRITY attribute. It is
        RECOMMENDED to only add these attributes to STUN messages
        containing a INTEGRITY attribute as this prevents tampering
        with the content of the attribute.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the client wants to receive feedback from the network it
        must add a null NETWORK-STATUS attribute. A null
        NETWORK_STATUS attribute is created by filling in the all the
        fields in the attribute with 0x0 values. This attribute MUST
        be added after the INTEGRITY attribute, as on-path devices may
        write information into this attribute. Having a readily
        available attribute to write into will save the the on-path
        device from growing buffers to add their own attribute. On
        path devices SHOULD not add their own NETWORK-STATUS attribute
        (or any other STUN attribute).
      </t>
      <t>
        If an agent receives a STUN request with a NETWORK-STATUS
        attribute after the INTEGRITY attribute, it should copy the
        content into a new NETWORK-STATUS attribute and add it before
        the INTEGRITY attribute when sending the STUN response. A new
        null NETWORK-STATUS attribute can be added after the INTEGRITY
        attribute. New STUN attributes described in this draft can
        also be added describing the stream in this direction.
      </t>
      <t>
        If an agent receives a STUN response with a NETWORK-STATUS
        attribute before the INTEGRITY attribute, this describes the
        stream in the upstream direction. A NETWORK-STATUS attribute
        after the INTEGRITY attribute describes the stream in the
        downstream direction.
      </t>
      <t>
        It might make sense to distinguish DISCUSS packets from normal STUN
        packets. This would prevent unnecessary processing of normal
        STUN packets on the network nodes.
      </t>
      <t><cref anchor="Q2" source="palmarti">
        A few alternatives (Needs discussion):
        ---1: 
            Alter the STUN magic cookie. (But than i would not be a
            STUN packet anymore, and that raises a new set of
            problems)
        ---2:
            Add a special this is DISCUSS attribute. This must be the
            first attribute in the message. This allows for network
            node to look for DISCUSS packets at a fixed offset without
            needing to parse the entire packet.
        ---3:
            Alter the transaction id. This might be problematic if
            using it in conjunction with ICE connectivity checks. But
            probably fine in other scenarios.
        ---4:  
            Define a new STUN Method. Also brakes ICE, makes it
            harder to tag onto attributes to already in use messages.

        This section describes the processing of DISCUSS packets by
        network devices.
      </t>
      <section title="Packet Processing by Network Device">
        <t>
          Network devices are said to support DISCUSS if they perform
          inspection of packets being forward or switched in order to
          identify an DISCUSS STUN packet.  These devices will also be
          able to read/write STUN attributes to/from this packet.  It
          is not required that every network device in the path
          support DISCUSS.  It is expected that DISCUSS will have the
          most value being implemented at certain points in the
          network (PIN's) such as WAN edge devices, wireless access
          devices, and Internet gateways.
        </t>
        <t>
          Network devices that support DISCUSS MAY utilize the
          information provided by the application in the STUN
          attributes to modify their behavior.  These include the
          attributes defined in this document with the exception of
          the NETWORK-STATUS attribute.  The NETWORK-STATUS attribute
          SHOULD NOT be used by the DISCUSS capable network device to
          modify its behavior.  The intent of the NETWORK-STATUS
          attribute is for the application to modify its behavior.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the NETWORK-STATUS attributes exists in a DISCUSS packet
          after an INTEGRITY attribute, the DISCUSS capable network
          device MUST process it as described in this section.
          NETWORK-STATUS attributes that exist before the INTEGRITY
          attribute MUST NOT be modified by the network device.  The
          modifications to the NETWORK-STATUS attribute are:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> Update the Node Cnt field in the attribute.  The
              device SHALL increment this field by one unless it is at
              its maximum (saturated) value.  If the field is at its
              maximum value, the device SHALL NOT modify this field.
            </t>
            <t>
              Overwrite the attribute CS bit if the value at this
              device is "worst" than the current value.  In other
              words, only write to this bit if the device is
              experiencing congestion on relevant queues/interfaces
              for this flow AND the current value of this field is 0
              (Off).
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The determination of congestion at a device is out of the
          scope of this document.  Setting of CS bit to On by the
          device is meant to provide direct feedback to the
          application of potential or current loss of packets in its
          flow (s).  The application can then react to this indication
          by altering its encoding of information in the packet to
          deal with congestion/packet loss, e.g. reduce its encoding
          rate or switch to embedded encoding.  Devices SHOULD ensure
          that the DISCUSS capable applications that do react to
          congestion notification by reducing their transmission rate
          be treated properly to ensure fairness with non reacting
          applications (i.e. ensure fairness for well behaving
          applications).
        </t>
        <t>
          The DISCUSS STUN packet SHOULD experience minimal extra
          processing delay through the DISCUSS capable network device
          relative to non-DISCUSS packets in the flow.  The DISCUSS
          STUN packet MAY be placed out of order in the packet flow,
          but SHOULD NOT be delayed more than a few packet interval
          times.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Interaction with DSCP">
        <t>
          One of the attributes that may be added to the STUN packet
          by the application is the STREAM-PRIORITY attribute.  This
          attribute indicates the relative priority of streams inside
          of an application session.  This attribute is compatible
          with the use of DSCP (or other priority markings) at the
          networking layer as described in this section.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since transport layer markings may be modified by middle
          boxes or devices in the path or at the interface of the
          application itself due to the lack of support in the OS
          network stack, the STREAM-PRIORITY attribute can be used as
          a mechanism for ensuring proper QoS treatment through
          multiple domains.  DISCUSS capable device may use the
          STREAM-PRIORITY attribute to remark the DSCP value to the
          appropriate value.  DSCP re-marking based on STREAM-PRIORITY
          attribute may make sense at certain PIN's, e.g. gateway
          between network domains (e.g. managed network to/from
          Internet), access switches in managed network, etc.  The
          translation from the Priority number in the STREAM-PRIORITY
          attribute to the correct transport layer marking (e.g. DSCP)
          is implementation specific and out of the scope of this
          document.

<section title="Interaction with ICE">
      <t>
        An ICE connectivity check is performed by sending a STUN
        Binding indication. Prior to sending the agent can add one
        STREAM-TYPE attribute. If added, only one MUST be added. This
        is to avoid unnecessary large STUN packets during the
        connectivity checks. If the connectivity check is sent on a
        5-tuple that multiplexes different types of media and more
        detailed information wants to be signalled it should be done
        after the connectivity check phase is finished.
      </t>
      <t>
        This limits the information the STUN messages are able to
        convey during the connectivity checks, but also avoids adding
        network confusion with BANDWIDTH-USAGE attributes describing
        different paths that never going to be utilized.

    <section title="Multiplexed Streams">
      <t>
        In some scenarios a 5-tuple can be used to transport several
        media streams. BUNDLE
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation" />
        describes such a mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        When describing the stream with a STREAM-TYPE attribute there
        are two possibilities to describe the streams that are
        multiplexed. Adding one attribute for each type (Audio,
        Video,++), or to save a few bits on the wire it is also
        possible to construct the STREAM-TYPE so a one type value
        describes several types. For example audio have the value of 1
        and application data have the value of 4. If the STREAM_TYPE
        value is set to 5 the only combination that gives that is
        audio and application data.
      </t>
      <t>
        The other attributes BANDWIDTH-USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY and
        NETWORK-STATUS SHOULD only be added once as they describe the
        behavior of the 5-tuple and not individual streams.

          It is possible to combine the stream types if a stream
          contains more than one type.

        <t>
          If a 5-tuple is used to send both a audio and video stream,
          the stream type can be set to 0x0006. This can be useful if
          the application wants to hint that the 5-tuple contains
          several streams, This is useful if the attribute is added to
          STUN binding requests during ICE connectivity checks. If
          more information regarding multiplexed streams is needed it
          is possible to add more than one attribute to a STUN message
          (See section ??). This can be done to STUN messages that are
          being sent after the connectivity check phase is finished
          (Keep-alive, consent freshness). During this phase the added
          size of the STUN messages pose no security threat.

      <t>
        This section records the status of known implementations of the
        protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
        Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref
        target="RFC6982"></xref>. The description of implementations in this
        section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
        progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any
        individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
        presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not
        intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
        implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that
        other implementations may exist.
      </t>

      <t>
        According to <xref target="RFC6982"></xref>, "this will allow
        reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents
        that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of
        valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
        protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use
        this information as they see fit".

              Draft was implemented with internal video test
              clients. Wireless access point implemented STUN
              detection in the media path and acted on the information
              in the DISCUSS attributes. After running tests in
              different congestion scenarios it is clear that sharing
              information between endpoint and network can help with
              congestion and end-user experience. This approach
              required little effort to implement on the client side.

        Due to the security implications described in <xref
        target="I-D.thomson-mmusic-ice-webrtc"></xref> where large
        STUN packet are used to amplify an attack, keeping the added
        STUN attributes small is a important design consideration.
      </t>
      <t>
        To avoid unwanted information leakage the new defined STUN
        attributes defined in this draft are strictly defined. No more
        information should be leaked that an on-path device could
        learn by observing the stream over time or do some deep packet
        analysis. This draft would benefit from more discussions on
        this topic.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is also worth noticing that the STUN attributes defined
        should be treated as hints, and more work is needed regarding
        how to deal with misbehaving clients or network devices.
