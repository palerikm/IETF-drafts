    <abstract>
      <t>Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
      many application providers and network operators. They often rely on
      these capabilities to deploy and/or support a wide range of
      applications. These applications, and the packet flows they generate and
      consume, may have specific connectivity requirements that can be met if
      made known to the network. Historically, this functionality has been
      implemented to the extent possible using heuristics, which inspect and
      infer flow characteristics. Heuristics may be based on port ranges,
      network separation (e.g. subnets or VLANS, or Deep Packet Inspection
      (DPI). But many application flows in current usages are dynamic,
      adaptive, time-bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, asymmetric, used on
      multipurpose devices, and have different priorities depending on
      direction of flow, user preferences, and other factors. Any combination
      of these properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective
      and may result in compromises to application security or user
      privacy.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Networks today, whether public or private, are challenged with
      demands to support rapidly increasing amounts of traffic. New channels
      for creating and consuming rich media are deployed at a rapid pace.
      Pervasive video and access on demand are becoming second nature to
      consumers. Communication applications make extensive use of rich media,
      placing unprecedented quality of experience expectation on the
      underlying network. These trends present challenges for network forecast
      and planning operations.</t>

      <t>Now more so than ever before, identification and treatment of
      application flows are critical for the successful deployment and
      operation of a growing number of business and household applications.
      These applications are based on wide range of signaling protocols and
      deployed by a diverse set of application providers that is not
      necessarily affiliated with the network providers across which the
      applications are used.</t>

      <t>Historically, identification of application flows has been
      accomplished using heuristics, which inspect and infer flow
      characteristics based on port ranges, network separation, or DPI. Each
      of these techniques suffers from a set of limitations, particularly in
      the face of challenges on the network outlined previously.</t>

      <t>Heuristic-based approaches may not be efficient and require
      continuous updates of application signatures. Port based solutions
      suffer from port overloading and inconsistent port usage. Network
      separation techniques like IP subnetting are error prone and increase
      network management complexity. DPI is computationally expensive and
      becomes a greater challenge with the wider adoption of encrypted
      signaling and secured media. An additional drawback of DPI is that any
      insights are not available, or need to be recomputed, at network nodes
      further down the application flow path.</t>

    <section title="Typical Workflows">
      <t>Various heuristic based approaches are used prevalently and
      successfully for two types of work flows:<list counter="1"
          style="numbers">
          <t>Provide network operators with visibility into traffic for
          troubleshooting, capacity planning, accounting and billing, and
          other off network work flows. This is done by exporting observed
          traffic analysis via protocols such as IPFIX <xref
          target="RFC7011"/>and SNMP <xref target="RFC3416"/>.</t>

          <t>Provide differentiated network services for specific traffic
          according to network operator defined policies, including traffic
          classification, policing and shaping (e.g. <xref
          target="RFC2475"/>), providing admission control (e.g. <xref
          target="RFC6601"/>), impacting routing, and permitting passage of
          specific traffic (e.g. firewall functions).</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Limitations of Heuristic Based Solutions">
      <t>These typical work flows, visibility and differentiated network
      services, are critical in many networks. However, their reliance on
      inspection and observation limits the ability to enable these work flows
      more widely. Reasons for this include the following:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Simple observation based classification based on TCP/UDP port
          numbers often result in incorrect results due to port overloading
          (i.e. ports used by applications other than those claiming the port
          with IANA).</t>

          <t>More and more traffic is encrypted, rendering DPI impossible,
          inefficient, or much more complex, and sometimes at the expense of
          privacy or security (e.g. need to share encryption keys with
          intermediary proxy performing DPI).</t>

          <t>Visibility generally requires inspecting the signaling traffic of
          applications. This traffic may flow through a different network path
          than the actual application data traffic. Impacting the traffic
          behavior is ineffective in those scenarios.</t>

          <t>Extensions to signaling protocols can result in false negatives
          or false positives during inspection.</t>

          <t>Network services leveraging DPI traffic classification impact the
          application behavior by impacting its traffic, but they do not
          provide explicit feedback to the application. This results in a lost
          opportunity for the application to gain insight and adjust its
          operation accordingly.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Limitations of Existing Signaling Mechanisms">
      <t>The IETF has standardized several mechanisms involving explicit
      signaling between applications and the network that may be used to
      support visibility and differentiated network services work flows.
      Unfortunately, none of these has experienced widespread deployment
      success, nor are they well suited for the applications usages described
      previously. Existing signaling options include the following:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>RSVP <xref target="RFC2205"/>is the original on-path signaling
          protocol standardized by the IETF. It is transported out-of-band and
          could be used to signal information about any transport protocol
          traffic (it currently supports TCP and UDP). Its original goal was
          to provide admission control. Its requirement for explicit
          reservation of resources end to end proved too heavy for most
          network environments. Its success was further impacted by its
          reliance on router-alert, which often leads to RSVP packets being
          filtered by intervening networks, and by its requirement for access
          to a raw socket, something that is generally not available to
          applications running in user space. To date, more lightweight
          signaling work flows utilizing RSVP have not been standardized
          within the IETF.</t>

          <t>NSIS (next Steps in Signaling) <xref target="RFC5978"/>is the
          next iteration of RSVP-like signaling defined by the IETF. It
          focused on the same fundamental work flow as RSVP admission control
          as its main driver, and because it did not provide significant
          enough use-case benefits over RSVP, it has seen even less adoption
          than RSVP.</t>

          <t>DiffServ style packet marking <xref target="RFC4594"/>can help
          provide QoS in some environments but DSCP markings are often
          modified or removed at various points in the network or when
          crossing network boundaries. There are additional limitations when
          using DiffServ with real-time communications applications, and the
          DART working group has been chartered to write a document that
          explains the limitations that exist with DiffServ when used with RTP
          in general as well in the specific RTCWeb cases.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Efforts in Progress">
      <t>There are a variety of evolving signaling options proposals for
      identification and differentiated treatment of application flows to fill
      where heuristic based approached or not sufficient.s are currently being
      used. It seems clear that there will be not be a one-protocol-fits-all
      solution. Every protocol is currently defined in its own silo, creating
      duplicate or inconsistent information models. This results in duplicate
      work, more operational complexity and an inability to convert
      information between protocols to leverage the best protocol option for
      each specific use case. Examples of evolving signaling options include
      the following:<list style="symbols">
          <t>STUN <xref target="RFC5389"/> is an on-path, in-band signaling
          protocol that could be extended to provide signaling to on-path
          network devices. It provides an easily inspected packet signature,
          at least for transport protocols such as UDP. Through its extensions
          TURN <xref target="RFC5766"/> and ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/>, it
          is becoming prevalent in application signaling driven by the initial
          use-case of providing NAT and firewall traversal capabilities and
          detecting local and remote candidates for peer-to-peer media
          sessions. The TRAM working group is chartered to update TURN and
          STUN to make them more suitable for WebRTC.</t>

          <t>Port Control Protocol (PCP) <xref target="RFC6887"/> provides a
          mechanism to describe a flow to the network. The primary driver for
          PCP is creating port mappings on NAT and firewall devices. When
          doing this, PCP pushes flow information from the host into the
          network (specifically to the network's NAT or firewall device), and
          receives information back from the network (from the NAT or firewall
          device). It is not meant to be used end-to-end but rather
          independently on one "edge" of a traffic flow. It is therefore an
          attractive alternative because it allows the introduction of
          application to network signaling without relying on the remote peer.
          This is especially useful in multi-domain communications.</t>

          <t>Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) is a working group
          chartered to provide interfaces for management applications, network
          controllers, and user applications to make specific demands on the
          network.</t>

          <t>Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) is a
          non-working group mailing list intended to enable discussion of the
          architecture, use-cases, and requirements that provide abstraction
          and virtual control of transport networks to various
          applications/clients.</t>

          <t>Prefix coloring has been proposed for use in HOMENET and 6MAN
          working groups to provide differentiated services to applications
          based on IP address.</t>

          <t>RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) has been
          chartered to address the lack of generally accepted congestion
          control mechanisms for interactive real-time media, which is often
          carried via sets of flows using RTP over UDP. Explicit exchanges of
          flow characteristics and congestion information between applications
          and the network could play an important role in such mechanisms.</t>

          <t>Transport Services (TAPS) is an effort to create a working group
          to define transport services that are exposed to internet
          applications. A TAP enabled application identifies its needs of the
          locally available transports services via an API. Some of the
          information provided is the same as what AEON proposes to have the
          application communicate to the network. Furthermore, the transport
          services of TAPS could benefit from this communication with the
          network.</t>

          <t>Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a working group chartered to
          address issues associated with the deployment of service functions
          (e.g. firewalls, load balancers) in large-scale environments.
          Service function chaining is the definition and instantiation of an
          ordered set of instances of such service functions, and the
          subsequent "steering" of traffic flows through those service
          functions. Flow characteristics communicated via AEON could be used
          as input into the an SFC classifier and it could be transported as
          SFC metadata.</t>
