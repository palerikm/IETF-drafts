    <abstract>
      <t>This specification describes the use of the RSVP resource reservation
      protocol for signaling flow metadata attributes.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Flow Metadata attributes are information elements (attributes) that
      identify flow characteristics, such as the type of media carried by
      application flows (e.g. video), the service class, the application that
      originated the flow, and others. The definition of the Flow Metadata
      technology and some of the attributes are defined in <xref
      target="I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework"/>. The flow
      attributes can be signaled over the flow path and inspected by
      intermediate network nodes for the purpose of applying differentiated
      flow treatment or collect network analytics. This specification proposes
      the use of RSVP as signaling protocol to carry the Flow Metadata using a
      new RSVP object. Two C-Type values are proposed for this object to allow
      for two possible encodings.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Flow Metadata Object">
      <t>This specification proposes a new RSVP object with Class-Num from the
      0x11bbbbbb range. To support informational metadata attribute processing
      on the path to the receiver, the sender inserts the Metadata object into
      an IPv4 or IPv6 Path message (i.e. Path messages with SESSION Class = 1
      and SENDER_TEMPLATE Class = 11). The Metadata object SHOULD appear only
      once in the message.</t>

      <t>The object definition is given in Section 2.1 while the details of
      processing are covered in Section 2.2</t>

      <section title="FLOW_METADATA Class ">
        <t>FLOW_METADATA Class = 234</t>

        <t>Two encodings are defined, both of which can carry the same IPFIX
        registered attributes as defined in <xref
        target="I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework"/>. The first
        encoding (Basic IPFIX FLOW_METADATA) has less flexibility and lower
        encoding efficiency. This version of the encoding is refrenced here
        for legacy reasons. It does not suport a range of options that the
        second one does, including the signaling of sender and receiver
        attributes, security elements, distinction of originator of the
        attributes and ease of extensibility.</t>

        <section title="Basic IPFIX FLOW_METADATA Object">
          <t>Basic IPFIX FLOW_METADATA Object: Class = 234, C-Type = 1</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>The metadata attributes are encoded in IPFIX format, as
              described in <xref target="RFC5101"/>, with the following
              restrictions when creating the object:<list style="symbols">
                  <t>Options Template Record MUST NOT be present</t>

                  <t>One and only one Template Record MUST be present</t>

                  <t>One and only one Data Record MUST be included</t>
                </list></t>

              <t>An intermediate node that supports this specification SHOULD
              ignore any Options Template Record. It SHOULD only decode and
              process the first occurring Template and Data Records.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Enhanced Protocol Independent FLOW_METADATA Object">
          <t>Enhanced Protocol Independent FLOW_METADATA Object: Class = 234,
          C-Type = 2</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>The contents and encoding rules for this object are specified
              in <xref target="I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework"/>
              and <xref
              target="I-D.choukir-tsvwg-flow-metadata-encoding"/>.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Semantic of carrying the Metadata Object">
        <t>The Metadata Object included in the Path message carries attributes
        from the sender of the flow towards the receiver. If the sender does
        not support the Metadata attribute, they may instead be inserted by a
        proxy along the path of the flow. Metadata RSVP nodes on path may
        modify the metadata attributes for purpose of influencing policy
        toward the receiver.</t>

        <t>The node that originates Metadata information in a Path message may
        do so for the sole purpose of signaling Metadata information only. To
        indicate this case, the SENDER_TSPEC objects fields (as defined by
        <xref target="RFC2210"/>) should be set to 0:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Token Bucket Rate [r]</t>

            <t>Token Bucket Size [b]</t>

            <t>Peak Data Rate [p]</t>

            <t>Minimum Policed Unit [m]</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If the Metadata object is inserted in a Path message used for <xref
        target="RFC2210"/> reservation requests, then all the rules of RSVP
        reservation request apply and in addition any actions driven purely by
        the metadata attributes may equally take place.</t>

        <t>While the Metadata Object may be included in a Resv message, the
        specific processing rules for this option is left for followup
        documents or future versions of this specification.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing by a Non-Metadata Capable RSVP Router">
        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC2205"/>, a node that does not
        understand the Metadata object, should ignore but forward it,
        unexamined and unmodified. When received in Path or Resv messages, it
        should be saved with the corresponding state and forwarded in any
        refresh message resulting from that state.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing by a Metadata Capable RSVP Router">
        <t>The Metadata object may be inserted by the data flow initiating
        endpoint or network nodes along the path. The means by which an
        implementation determines the content of the Metadata object is
        outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>Intermediate nodes that support this specification, decode the Flow
        Metadata information as indicated by the C-Type field only when
        received in Path message. Depending on the attributes, local
        configuration and policies, the node may take some actions. The
        Metadata attribute semantics are described in <xref
        target="I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework"/>. The received
        Flow Metadata object is stored against the Path state. When a
        subsequent Path message is received with a modified Metadata object,
        the intermediate node determines the attributes that have been
        removed, modified and/or added by comparing the old and new objects,
        and takes appropriate actions.</t>

        <t>As a result of these actions, an intermediate node may add new
        attributes to the Metadata object received in the Path message and
        signal them downstream. It can also modify some of the attributes
        present in the Flow Metadata object. RSVP does not have any transport
        protocol specific restrictions and the exact set of attributes that
        can be inserted and modified by intermediate nodes is described in
        <xref target="I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework"/>. Depending
        on local policies, an intermediate node may also remove some of the
        attributes received in the Metadata object of a Path message before
        forwarding downstream.</t>

        <t>An intermediate node that receives a Resv message with a Metadata
        Object SHOULD store the object against the state and forward it
        unexamined and unmodified.</t>
