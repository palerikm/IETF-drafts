              TURN Extension for Third Party Authorization
               draft-reddy-tram-turn-third-party-authz-00

Abstract

   This document proposes the use of OAuth to obtain and validate
   ephemeral TOKENs that can be used for TURN authentication.  The usage
   of ephemeral tokens ensure that access to a TURN server can be
   controlled even if the tokens are compromised, as is the case in
   WebRTC where TURN credentials must be specified in Javascript.  It
   also addresses the need for stronger authentication described in
   [I-D.reddy-behave-turn-auth].

1.  Introduction

   TURN [RFC5766] is a protocol that is often used to improve the
   connectivity of P2P applications.  By providing a cloud-based relay
   service, TURN ensures that a connection can be established even when
   one or both sides is incapable of a direct P2P connection.  However,
   as a relay service, it imposes a nontrivial cost on the service
   provider.  Therefore, access to a TURN service is almost always
   access-controlled.

   TURN provides a mechanism to control access via "long-term" username/
   password credentials that are provided as part of the TURN protocol.
   It is expected that these credentials will be kept secret; if the
   credentials are discovered, the TURN server could be used by
   unauthorized users or applications.  However, in web applications,
   ensuring this secrecy is typically impossible.  To address this
   problem and the ones described in [I-D.reddy-behave-turn-auth], this
   document proposes the use of third party authorization using OAuth
   for TURN.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   o  WebRTC Server: A web server that supports WebRTC
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview].

   o  access token: The OAuth 2.0 access token.

   o  mac_key: The session key generated by the authorization server.
      Note that the lifetime of the session key is equal to the lifetime
      of the access token.

   o  kid: The name of the key (key id), which is an identifier
      generated by the resource server.

3.  Solution Overview

   This specification uses the token type 'Assertion' (aka self-
   contained token) described in [RFC6819] where all the information
   necessary to authenticate the validity of the token is contained
   within the token itself.  This approach has the benefit of avoiding a
   protocol between the TURN server and the authorization server for
   token validation, thus reducing latency.

   The exact mechanism used by a client to obtain a token from the OAuth
   authorization server is outside the scope of this document.  For
   example, a client could make an HTTP request to an authorization
   server to obtain a token that can be used to avail TURN services.
   The TURN token is returned as JSON, along with other OAuth Parameters
   like token type, mac_key, mac_algorithm, kid, token lifetime etc.
   The client is oblivious to the content of the TOKEN.  The TOKEN is
   securely embedded within a TURN request sent to the TURN server.
   Once the TURN server has determined the token is valid, TURN services
   are offered for a determined period of time.

   For example HTTP response from Authorization server:

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store

        {
          "access_token":
      "eyJhbGciOiJSU0ExXzUiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDK0hTMjU2In0.

        }

4.  Obtaining a Token Using OAuth

   A TURN client should know the authentication capability of the TURN
   server before deciding to use third party authorization with it.  A
   TURN client initially makes a request without any authorization.  If
   the TURN server supports or mandates third party authorization, it
   will return an error message indicating support for third party
   authorization.  Following the procedures of long-term credential
   mechanism of [RFC5389], the TURN server includes an ERROR-CODE
   attribute with a value of 401 (Unauthorized), a nonce value in a
   NONCE attribute and a SOFTWARE attribute that gives information about
   the TURN server's software.  The TURN servers also includes
   additional STUN attribute THIRD-PARTY-AUTHORIZATION signalling the
   TURN client that the TURN server supports third party authorization.

   The following mapping of OAuth concepts to WebRTC is used :

              +----------------------+----------------------------+
              |         OAuth        |            WebRTC          |
              +======================+============================+
              | Client               | WebRTC client              |
              +----------------------+----------------------------+
              | Resource owner       | WebRTC server              |
              +----------------------+----------------------------+
              | Authorization server | Authorization server       |
              +----------------------+----------------------------+
              | Resource server      | TURN Server                |
              +----------------------+----------------------------+

         Figure 2: OAuth terminology mapped to WebRTC terminology

   Using the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, a WebRTC client (third-
   party application) obtains limited access to a TURN (resource server)
   on behalf of the WebRTC server (resource owner or authorization
   server).  The WebRTC client requests access to resources controlled
   by the resource owner (WebRTC server) and hosted by the resource
   server (TURN server).  The WebRTC client obtains access token,
   lifetime, session key (in the mac_key parameter), key-id and
   mac_algorithm OAuth parameters from the authorization server as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac].  The TURN client conveys
   the access token and other OAuth parameters learnt from the
   authorization server to the resource server (TURN server).  The TURN
   obtains the session key via the access token.  Both of these two key
   distribution steps are described in more detail in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac].  The TURN server validates the token,
   computes the message integrity of the request and takes appropriate
   action i.e permits the TURN client to create allocations.  This is
   shown in an abstract way in Figure 3.

                          Figure 3: Interactions

   OAuth in [RFC6749] defines four grant types.  This specification uses
   the OAuth grant type "Implicit" explained in section 1.3.2 of
   [RFC6749] where the WebRTC client is issued an access token directly.
   The scope of the access token explained in section 3.3 of [RFC6749]
   MUST be TURN.

5.  Forming a Request

   When a TURN server responds that third party authorization is
   required, a TURN client re-attempts the request, this time including
   access token, timestamp, lifetime, kid and mac_algorithm values in
   ACCESS-TOKEN, TIMESTAMP, LIFETIME, KEY-ID and MAC-ALGORITHM STUN
   attributes.  The TURN client includes a MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute
   as the last attribute in the message over the contents of the TURN
   message using the mac_key and mac_algorithm.  MESSAGE-INTEGRITY
   attribute is calculated using the other rules specified in section
   15.4 of [RFC5389].

   The difference in comparison to long-term credential mechanism is
   that TURN client MUST not include the USERNAME attribute in the
   request.

6.  TURN Server validating Request

   The TURN server, on receiving a request, performs checks listed in
   section 10.2.2 of [RFC5389] in addition to the following steps to
   verify that the access token is valid:

   o  The mac_key is transported to the TURN server using the mechanism
      explained in section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac].

   o  The TURN server uses the mac_key and mac_algorithm to compute the
      value for the message integrity and if the resulting value does
      not match the contents of the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute then
      reject the request with an error response 401 (Unauthorized).

   o  The TURN server verifies that no replay took place by comparing
      the value in the TIMESTAMP attribute with the local time.  The
      timestamp verification procedure is described in Section 6.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac].

   o  If all the checks pass, the TURN server continues to process the
      request.  Any response generated by the server MUST include the
      MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute, computed using the mac_key and
      mac_algorithm.

   o  The TURN server does not check for the presence of USERNAME.

   A TURN response is discarded by the client if the value computed for
   message integrity using mac_key and mac_algorithm does not match the
   contents of the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute.

7.  STUN Attributes

   The following STUN attributes are introduced to accomplish third
   party authorization.

7.1.  THIRD-PARTY-AUTHORIZATION

   This attribute is used by the TURN server to inform the client that
   it supports third party authorization.  This attribute has no value
   part and thus the attribute length field is 0.

7.2.  ACCESS-TOKEN

   The access token is issued by the authorization server.  OAuth does
   not impose any limitation on the length of the access token but since
   STUN messages cannot exceed 548 bytes (Section 7.1 of [RFC5389]),
   access token length needs to be restricted to fit within the maximum
   STUN message size.  The value of ACCESS-TOKEN is a variable-length
   value.  Its length MUST be less than 513 bytes.

   Since the access token is valid for a period of time the resource
   server MUST cache it so that it does not need to be provided in every
   request from the client.  The ACCESS-TOKEN MUST only be included in
   the first request from the client to the server but MUST NOT be
   included in a subsequent request/response.

7.3.  TIMESTAMP

   64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp.  The value
   indicates the time since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC, by using a fixed
   point format.  In this format, the integer number of seconds is
   contained in the first 48 bits of the field, and the remaining 16
   bits indicate the number of 1/64K fractions of a second (Native
   format - Unix).

7.4.  KEY-ID

   key id is an identifier generated by the resource server.  This key
   is used to select the appropriate keying material for decryption.
   This keying material is a symmetric or an asymmetric long-term key
   established between the resource server and the authorization server,
   as shown in Figure 3 as AS-RS key.  The establishment of this long-
   term key is outside the scope of this specification and discussed in
   Appendix A.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac].

7.5.  MAC-ALGORITHM

   Indicates the MAC algorithm.  The MAC Algorithm ID field contains an
   IKEv2 Transform ID of Transform Type 3 [RFC4306].  All TURN
   implementations MUST support AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_160 (7) [RFC4595].

8.  Security Considerations

   When OAuth is used the interaction between the client and the
   authorization server requires Transport Layer Security (TLS) with a
   ciphersuite offering confidentiality protection.  The session key
   MUST NOT be transmitted in clear since this would completely destroy
   the security benefits of the proposed scheme.  Other security
   considerations are discussed in [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following attributes to the STUN
   attribute registry [iana-stun],

   o  THIRD-PARTY-AUTHORIZATION

   o  ACCESS-TOKEN

   o  TIMESTAMP

   o  KEY-ID

   o  MAC-ALGORITHM
