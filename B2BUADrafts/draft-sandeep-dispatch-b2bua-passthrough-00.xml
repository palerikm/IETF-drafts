    <abstract>
      <t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are 
      often designed to be on the signalling and/or media path. B2BUAs when present on 
      the signalling path operates  on the SIP message protocol layer and often modifies 
      the signalling headers.  When acting on Signaling path,these B2BUAs are likely to 
      receive REGISTER messages as well apart from call control messages. It is critical 
      that B2BUAs handle these REGISTER messages properly.
      </t>
      <t>
   This document defines behavior for a B2BUA for handling REGISTER messages.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
     For any collaboration solution to provide services to the end users, the endpoints
     like deskphones, softphones etc. need to register to a call control agent. 
     The end users within enterprise and remote workers are securely terminated to an Edge
     device in the Headquarters or Cloud. This edge device is generally a 
     B2BUA in most of the SIP deployments.
     
      </t>
      <t>
     The B2BUA seamlessly handles all interworking for call signaling, and may
     additionally handle interworking for media as well. However, since the 
     endpoints register to the call control agent through this B2BUA, there is 
     a need to define the behaviour of the B2BUA for handling the SIP
     REGISTER message from the endpoint towards the Call control agents.

      </t>
      <t>
     This draft will outline the recommended behaviour of the B2BUA for handling 
     SIP registration cases. 
     
      </t>

    
    </section>
    
  <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
        
        <t>
           The following generalized terms are defined in [RFC3261], Section 6.
</t>

 <t>
   B2BUA: A SIP Back-to-Back User Agent, which is the logical
    combination of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client
   (UAC).
</t>

 <t>
   UAS: A SIP User Agent Server.
</t>

 <t>
   UAC: A SIP User Agent Client.
</t>

 <t>
   All of the pertinent B2BUA terminology and taxonomy used in this
   document is based on [RFC7092].
   </t>
  </section>     


    <section title="REGISTER handling by B2BUA">
      <t>
	In any VoIP network, B2BUA acts as edge device to interface the enterprise network with the service provider or the internet directly. The B2BUA acts as an entry/exit point for all SIP communication. Thus, when we have scenarios of endpoint registering to the call control agent via the B2BUA, we need the B2BUA to be aware of this registration and allow for passing across this SIP registration towards the call control agent.

      </t>
	
      <t>
	The following diagrams depict the various scenario where B2BUA need to handle SIP REGISTER messages. The SIP REGISTER message is as described in <xref
        target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref>.

The endpoint will have the B2BUA's address as the Outbound proxy address. Thus, making sure that the B2BUA is in the path of the SIP REGISTER message.
