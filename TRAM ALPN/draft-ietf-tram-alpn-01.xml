    <abstract>
      <t>Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) labels for the Session
      Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and Traversal Using Relays
      around NAT (TURN) are defined in this document to allow the application
      layer to negotiate STUN, TURN within the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      connection. The STUN ALPN protocol identifier and TURN ALPN identifier
      applies to both TLS and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>STUN can be securely transported using TLS-over-TCP (referred to as
      TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>), as specified in <xref target="RFC5389"/>,
      or TLS-over-UDP (referred to as DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"/>), as
      specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tram-stun-dtls"/>.</t>

      <t>ALPN <xref target="RFC7301"/> enables an endpoint to positively
      identify STUN protocol and TURN in TLS/DTLS and distinguish them from
      other TLS/DTLS protocols. With ALPN, the client sends the list of
      supported application protocols as part of the TLS/DTLS ClientHello
      message. The server chooses a protocol and sends the selected protocol
      as part of the TLS/DTLS ServerHello message. The application protocol
      negotiation can thus be accomplished within the TLS/DTLS handshake,
      without adding network round-trips, and allows the server to associate a
      different certificate with each application protocol, if desired.</t>

      <t>TURN ALPN is useful in the following scenarios:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Consider an Enterprise network that deploys a TURN server in a
          DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ) to audit all media sessions from inside the
          Enterprise premises to any external peer. In this deployment, an
          Enterprise firewall could use the TURN ALPN identifer to detect, and
          act accordingly, the use of a TURN server outisde the Enterprise
          domain (i.e., a TURN server provided by an application server,
          access network etc).</t>

          <t>If a firewall is configured to block all outgoing traffic except
          for TCP traffic to specific ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS), a TURN
          server listening on its default ports (3478 for TCP/UDP, 5349 for
          TLS) would not be reachable. However, despite the restrictions
          imposed by the firewall, the TURN server can still be reached on the
          allowed HTTPS port if the TURN ALPN identifier is used to establish
          usage of TURN as part of the TLS handshake. In this case, the TURN
          ALPN identifier sent by the client will be used by the server to
          identify that the client intends to make a TURN request and it must
          act as a TURN server to relay the traffic to and from the remote
          peer.</t>

          <t>If a TURN server is in a resource exhausted state then it could
          use the TURN ALPN identifier sent by the client to identify that the
          connection will be used to allocate resouces, which the server
          cannot accommodate, and hence reject the DTLS handshake with fatal
          error.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document defines entries ("stun") and ("turn") in the
      "Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry
      established by <xref target="RFC7301"/> to identify the STUN protocol
      and usage of TURN.</t>

      <t>The following entry is to be added to the "Application Layer Protocol
      Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established by <xref

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The ALPN STUN protocol identifier does not introduce any specific
      security considerations beyond those detailed in the TLS ALPN Extension
      specification <xref target="RFC7301"/>. It also does not impact the
      security of TLS/DTLS session establishment nor the application data
      exchange.</t>
