      <t>This document provides guidelines on how to make ICE <xref
      target="RFC5245"></xref> conclude faster in IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack
      scenarios where broken paths exists.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>There is a need to introduce more fairness in the handling of
      connectivity checks in dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 ICE scenarios. Section
      4.1.2.1 of ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> points to <xref
      target="RFC3484"></xref> for prioritizing among the different IP
      families. <xref target="RFC3484"></xref> is obsoleted by <xref
      target="RFC6724"></xref> but following the recommendations from the
      updated RFC will still lead to prioritization of IPv6 over IPv4 with the
      same candidate type. There can be a lot of ICE candidates belonging to
      one address family which results in user-noticable setup delays if the
      path for that address family is broken.</t>

      <t>To avoid such user-noticable delays when the IPv6 path or IPv4 path
      is broken, this specification encourages earlier checking of the other
      address family. Greater IP address family fairness into ICE connectivity
      checks will lead to more sustained IPv6 deployment (so users will no
      longer have an incentive to disable IPv6), which incurs only a small
      penalty for the IPv4 connectivity checks.</t>

      <section anchor="notation" title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This document uses terminology defined in <xref
        target="RFC5245"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Improving ICE Dual-stack Fairness">
      <t>Candidates SHOULD be prioritized such that a long sequence of
      candidates belonging to the same address family be interleaved with
      candidates from the alternate IP family. For example, promoting IPv4
      candidates in the presence of many IPv6 addresses such that an IPv4
      address candidate is always present after a small sequence of IPv6
      addresses. This makes ICE connectivity checks more responsive to
      failures of an address family by reordering the candidates such that
      IPv6 and IPv4 candidates get a fair chance during connectivity
      checks.</t>

      <t>An ICE agent can choose an algorithm or a technique of its choice to
      promote IPv4 candidates.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Compatibility">
      <t>ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> section 4.1.2 states that the
      formula in section 4.1.2.1 SHOULD be used. Failing to do so may lead to
      ICE taking longer to converge as the checklist no longer will be
      coordinated. Therefore responsiveness of ICE candidate checks are
      improved when both sides support Happy-Eyeballs, both sides have the
      same number of candidate pairs, and both sides use the same Happy
      Eyeballs promotion algorithm.</t>

      <t>If each ICE agent uses a different algorithm to promote IPv4
      candidates, ICE connectivity checks will be as responsive as the least
      aggressive algorithm. This is because the MAX/MIN candiate-pair logic
      ensures that for a particular agent, a lower-priority candidate is never
      used (for media) until all higher-priority candidates have been
      tried.</t>

      <t>If only one ICE agent supports Happy-Eyeballs, there is potentially
      no change in pacing of ICE connectivity checks and the situation is no
      worse than what exists today</t>
