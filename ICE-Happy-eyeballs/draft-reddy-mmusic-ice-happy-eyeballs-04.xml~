      <t>
        This document provides guidelines on how to make ICE
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> conclude faster in IPv4/IPv6
        dual-stack scenarios where broken paths exists.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        There is a need to introduce more fairness in the handling of
        connectivity checks in dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 ICE scenarios.
        Section 4.1.2.1 of ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/> points to
        <xref target="RFC3484"/> for prioritizing among the different
        IP families.  <xref target="RFC3484"/> is obsoleted by
        <xref target="RFC6724"/> but following the recommendations
        from the updated RFC will still lead to prioritization of IPv6
        over IPv4 with the same candidate type. There can be a lot of
        ICE candidates belonging to one address family which results
        in user-noticable setup delays if the path for that address
        family is broken.
      </t>
      <t>
        To avoid such user-noticable delays when the IPv6 path or IPv4
        path is broken, this specification encourages earlier checking
        of the other address family. Greater IP address family
        fairness into ICE connectivity checks will lead to more
        sustained IPv6 deployment (so users will no longer have an
        incentive to disable IPv6), with incurs only a small penalty
        for the IPv4 connectivity checks.

    <section title="Improving ICE Dual-stack Fairness">
      <t>
        Candidates SHOULD be prioritized such that a long sequence of
        candidates belonging to the same address family be interleaved
        with candidates from the alternate IP family. For example,
        promoting IPv4 candidates in the presence of many IPv6
        addresses such that an IPv4 address candidate is always
        present after a small sequence of IPv6 addresses. This makes
        ICE connectivity checks more responsive to failures of an
        address family by reordering the candidates such that IPv6 and
        IPv4 candidates get a fair chance during connectivity checks.
      </t>  
      <t>
        An ICE agent can choose an algorithm or a technique of its
        choice to promote IPv4 candidates.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Compatibility">
      <t>
        ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/> section 4.1.2 states that the
        formula in section 4.1.2.1 SHOULD be used.  Failing to do so
        may lead to ICE taking longer to converge as the checklist no
        longer will be coordinated.  Therefore responsiveness of ICE
        candidate checks are improved when both sides support
        Happy-Eyeballs, both sides have the same number of candidate
        pairs, and both sides use the same Happy Eyeballs promotion
        algorithm.
      </t>
      <t>
        If each ICE agent uses a different algorithm to promote IPv4
        candidates, ICE connectivity checks will be as responsive as
        the least aggressive algorithm.  This is because the MAX/MIN
        candiate-pair logic ensures that for a particular agent, a
        lower-priority candidate is never used (for media) until all
        higher-priority candidates have been tried.
      </t>
      <t>
        If only one ICE agent supports Happy-Eyeballs, there is
        potentially no change in pacing of ICE connectivity checks and
        the situation is no worse than what exists today
